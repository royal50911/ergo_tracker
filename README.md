Everyone spends at least four hours sitting daily, so it is important to have a good posture. Our application, ergoTracker, has a
goal to notify users and help them keep track of their sitting posture at their workstation, office, or school. We use the Microsoft
Kinect, a simple device, to record user’s posture while sitting and notify them with a window notification to help correct their
posture. Also, their data will be available via the web server, with secured unique username and password, which allows the user to
monitor their sitting routine at workstation. With this health report, users can change their sitting posture while working or
studying.
